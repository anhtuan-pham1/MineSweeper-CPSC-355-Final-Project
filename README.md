# CPSC 355 Final Project in C: Card Game
The basic card game based on minesweeper I created for my CPSC 355 Computing Machinery 1 class. 

# Instructions:

There are 5 types of cards: positive values (+) which gives
players score, negative value (-) which deducts players score, bonus time gives players extra 10s, good suprise package double players score, bad suprised package takes half of players score away. The timer in the game is relative since there requirement of the project doesn't include multithread. User can exit the program anytime by typing 69 in either col or row input. The game has top score display
and auto-generated log file for highscore.

# Installation:

If you have set up C in your computer, you can simply navigate to the source foler and compile it using the following terminal command:
```bash
gcc -o mygame.c mygame
```
Then you can simply run ./mygame to start the game on your terminal
