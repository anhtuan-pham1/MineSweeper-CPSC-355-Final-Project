#CPSC 355 Final Project in C: Card Game
#Author: Anh Tuan Pham

#Instructions:
There is one file named mygame.c. Users can compile the file though the terminal by "cding" to the folder which contains the file and type
gcc mygame.c -o mygame then ./mygame #playername #a-number-between-5-and-20. There are 5 types of cards: positive values (+) which gives
players score, negative value (-) which deducts players score, bonus time gives players extra 10s, good suprise package double players score, bad suprised package takes half of players score away. The timer in the game is relative since there requirement of the project doesn't include multithread. User can exit the program anytime by typing 69 in either col or row input. The game has top score display
and auto-generated log file for highscore.
